Intro: [Bm], [Fm], [D#], [G#]-[Cm]-[Fm], [C#], [D#]

V:
[Bm]No one laughs at [Fm]God in a hospital
[D#]No one laughs at [G#]God in a [Cm]war
No one’s [Fm]laughing at God
When they’re [D#]starving or freezing or [C#]so very poor

No one laughs at God
When the doctor calls after some routine tests
No one’s laughing at God
When it’s gotten real late
And their kid’s not back from the party yet

No one laughs at God
When their airplane start to uncontrollably shake
No one’s laughing at God
When they see the one they love, hand in hand with someone else
And they hope that they’re mistaken

No one laughs at God
When the cops knock on their door
And they say we got some bad news, sir
No one’s laughing at God
When there’s a famine or fire or flood

R:
But God can be [Bm]funny[Fm]
At a cocktail [D#]party when listening to a [G#]good God-themed [Cm]joke, or
[Fm]Or when the crazies say [C#]He hates us
And they get so red in the [D#]head you think they’re ‘bout to choke
God can be [Bm]funny[Fm]
When told he’ll give you [D#]money if you just [G#]pray the right [Cm]way
And when p[Fm]resented like a genie who does [C#]magic like Houdini
Or grants [D#]wishes like Jiminy Cricket and [Fm]Santa Claus
[C#]God can be so hil[D#]arious
Ha [Bm]ha [Fm] [D#] [G#]
Ha [Bm]ha [Fm] [D#] [G#]

No one laughs at God in a hospital
No one laughs at God in a war
No one’s laughing at God
When they’ve lost all they’ve got
And they don’t know what for

No one laughs at God
On the day they realize
That the last sight they’ll ever see
Is a pair of hateful eyes
No one’s laughing at God
When they’re saying their goodbyes

(R)
