[G]

I can [G]feel you brea[Am7]thing
With your [G]hair on my [Am7]skin
As we [G]lie here wi[Am7]thin
The [G]night

[G]I'll pull the [C]sheets
When it's [G]cold on your [Am7]feet
Cause you'll [G]fall back to sl[Am7]eep
Every [G]time

Chorus:
[C]Grow old with [D]me
Let us [C]share what we [D]see
And oh the [C]best it could [D]be
Just you and [G]I

And our hands they might age
And our bodies will change
But we'll still be the same
As we are

We'll still sing our song
When our hair ain't so blonde
And our children have sung
We were right

They'll sing

Chorus

And the hairs they stand up
And my feet start to thump
Yer the feeling is dreaming
Around

You'll be the one
Make me hurt, make me come
Make me feel like I'm real
And alive

Chorus 2x
