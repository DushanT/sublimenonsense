[D]Hard to know, [D7]
Maybe if I [G]skim the stone, [Gm]
Walk a different [A]way back home, [Hm7]
It would all make [G]sense. [Gm]

Oh, shut my eyes,
Lose myself in teenage lies,
If I fell in love a thousand times,
Would it all make sense ?

Cause [A]I,
I've been [G]feeling pretty small,
Some[A]times,
Feel like I'm [G]sleeping down walls,
And every [A]lie,
I [Hm7]ever get a hold,
It seems to [Em]brea[A]k.

Ca-Call you up,
I can tell you just how much,
No, no maybe I'll just get drunk,
And it will all make sense.

Oh If I won so nice,
I convince my friends that you were right,
I can promise you my heart don't cry,
Would it all my sense ?

Cause I,
I've been feeling pretty small,
Sometimes,
Feel like I'm sleeping down walls,
And every lie,
I ever get a hold,
It seems to break.

Oh I,
I've been feeling pretty small,
Sometimes,
Feel like I'm sleeping down walls,
And every lie,
I ever get a hold,
It seems to break.
