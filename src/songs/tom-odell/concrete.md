[Verse]
Bm A                   D G
  Got me in my hotel room
Bm A                  D    G
  More pillows I could ever use
Bm A                      D G
  I think they call it luxury
Bm Em                     Em        F#7
 But it doesn't make a difference to me

[Chorus]
Bm        A     D    G                   Bm   A  
Cause I'd sleep on a bed that's made of concrete
D         G            Bm  A
Just the two of us and no sheet
D         G      Bm        A        D G
Just your feet rubbing up against mine

[Verse]
Bm A                             D G
  Staring at the picture on the wall
Bm A                            D            G
  Yeah it's pretty clever but, it's got no soul
Bm A                  D   G
  Show me a masterpiece
Bm Em                     Em        F#7
  And it wouldn't make difference to me

[Chorus]
Bm        A     D    G                   Bm   A  
Cause I'd sleep on a bed that's made of concrete
D         G            Bm  A
Just the two of us and no sheet
D         G      Bm        A        D G
Just your feet rubbing up against mine
    Bm         A        D G
Oh rubbing up against mine
    Bm         A        D G
Oh rubbing up against mine
    Bm         A        D G
Oh rubbing up against mine

[Interlude]
Em                     A
  I sit on these aeroplane's
D Dmaj7              Bm
   But I just wanna walk
Em                 A
  Play me these symphonies 
D Dmaj7              Bm
   But I just wanna talk
Em                  A
 So baby won't you come back
Em                  F#7
 Oh I need something real

[Chorus]
Bm        A  D    G                   Bm   A  
   I'd sleep on a bed that's made of concrete
D         G            Bm  A
Just the two of us and no sheet
D         G      Bm        A        D G
Just your feet rubbing up against mine
Bm        A  D    G                   Bm   A  
   I'd sleep on a bed that's made of concrete
D         G            Bm  A
Just the two of us and no sheet
D         G      Bm        A        D G
Just your feet rubbing up against mine
    Bm         A        D G
Oh rubbing up against mine
    Bm         A        D G
Oh rubbing up against mine
  Bm        A        D G
Rubbing up against mine
  Bm        A        D G  
Rubbing up against mine
