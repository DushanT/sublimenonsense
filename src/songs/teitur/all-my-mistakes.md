Intro: [A] 4x

[A]Who is to say who [E]wins or who lose[F#m]s [A] [F#m] 3x [A]
I [A]sing to myself at the [E]end of the day
When I [D]know[A] what the [D]blues is
And [E]all my mistakes have become[E7] masterpieces [A] [E] [A] [E]

[A]I was born in the [E]goodness of gra[F#m]ce [A] [F#m] 3x [A]
[A]Because of faith, [E]because of courage
Be[D]cause[A] of for[D]giveness
[E]All my mistakes have become[E7] masterpieces [A] [E] [A] [E]

There comes a [D]time
You must [Hm]stay in the moment
While [G#dim7/H]your heart's still [A]bleeding

[A7]There comes a [D]time
When you [Hm]must walk [G#dim7/H]away
Though your [A]heart's still [E]beating [E7]

[A]Who is to say who [E]wins or who lose[F#m]s [A] [F#m] 3x [A]
I [A]sing to myself at the [E]end of the day
When I [D]know[A] what the [D]blues is
[E]All my mistakes have become[E7] masterpieces
