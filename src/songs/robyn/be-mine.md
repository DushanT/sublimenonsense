V:
It's a [Bb]good thing [Cm]tears never sh[Ab]ow in the pouring rain
[Bb] [Cm] [Ab]
As if a [Bb]good thing [Cm]ever could ma[Ab]ke up for all the pain
[Bb] [Cm] [Ab]
There'll be no [Bb]last chance to [Cm]promise to ne[Ab]ver mess it up again
[Bb] [Cm] [Ab]
Just a [Bb]sweet pain of [Cm]watching your b[Ab]ack as you walk
As I'm [Bb]watching you [Cm]walk awa[Ab]y

B:
[Bb]And now you're [Cm]gone it's like an [Ab]echo [Eb]in my h[Bb]ead
And I re[Cm]member every [Ab]word [Eb]you [Bb]said

V:
It's a cold thing you never know all the ways I tried
It's a hard thing faking a smile when I feel like I'm falling apart inside
And now you're gone it's like an echo in my head
And I remember every word you said

B:
But you never were, and you never will be mine
No, you never were, and you never will be mine

V:
For the first time, there is no mercy in your eyes
And the cold wind's hitting my face and you're gone
And you're walking away

B:
And I am helpless, sometimes wishing's just no good
Cause you don't see me like I wish you would

Ch:
Cause you [Bb]never were, and you [Cm]never will be [Ab]mi[Eb]ne
No, you [Bb]never were, and you [Cm]never will be [Ab]mi[Eb]ne
There's a [Bb]moment to seize every[Cm]time that we meet
But you [Ab]always keep passing me [Eb]by
But you [Bb]never were, and you [Cm]never will be [Ab]mi[Eb]ne

V:
(I saw you at the station, you had your arm around what's-her-name
She had on that scarf I gave you
you got down to tie her laces)
Cause you never were, and you never will be mine
(You looked happy and that's great)
No, you never were, and you never will be mine
(I just miss you, that's all)

(Ch) 2x
