Intro:
[E], [H], [E], [H]
[A], [Esus4], [A], [Esus4]

[E]Face [H]me, are y[E]ou tired of [H]living?
Rep[A]lace, s[Esus4]he was s[A]o unfo[Esus4]rgiving
[C#mi]And I’m so frustrated,[A] so dilated
[H]And she’s telling me I’ve wasted my time
[C#mi]And I’m running back like,[A] just to face the facts right
[H]To tell me your voice takes me through the night

[C#mi]Your smile and y[A]our memory
[H]Simply eases me[C#mi] to sleep
[C#mi]In my ear while the w[A]hispering
[H]Melts my heart on every[C#mi] beat

Still you’re s[A]inging[H] lullabies and postcards to this [C#mi]place
And we’re a[A]sk[H]ing for so much m[C#mi]ore
Now you’re b[A]ringing[H] smiles and laughter to this [C#mi]face
While bad m[A]emories [H]are in pieces on the [C#mi]floor

Face me, are you tired of living?
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I’m so frustrated, so dilated
And she’s telling me I’ve wasted my time
And I’m running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night

Time past, heal this broken heart
Pulled away that sellotape
Take your time, ‘cos I won’t mind
I doubt if I even know that I’m awake

And still you’re singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we’re asking for so much more
Now you’re bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floor
