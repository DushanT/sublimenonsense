I [C]hurt m[D]yself t[Ami]oday to [C]see i[D]f I still[Ami] feel,
I f[C]ocus [D]on the [Ami]pain, the [C]only [D]thing that's [Ami]real.
The [C]needle [D]tears a [Ami]hole, the [C]old fa[D]miliar[Ami] sting,
try to [C]kill it[D] all a[Ami]way, but I [C]remember e[D]verything[G].

[Ami]What have I beco[F]me, [C]my sweetest f[G]riend ?
[Ami]Everyone I [F]know goes [C]away in the [G]end.
And[Ami] you could have it a[F]ll, [G]my empire of dirt,
[Ami]I will let you d[F]own, [G]I will make you hurt.


I [C]wear this [D]crown of [Ami]thorns [C]upon my li[D]ar's chai[Ami]r,
f[C]ull of bro[D]ken though[Ami]ts I can[C]not repai[D, Ami]r.
Beneath[C] the stains of[D] time the [Ami]feeling disap[C, D, Ami]pears,
y[C]ou are someo[D]ne else, I a[Ami]m sti[C]ll right [D, G]here.

Wha[Ami]t have I become, [F] my sw[-]ee[C, G]test friend ?
[Ami]Everyone I know go[F]es away in the end[C, G].
And you [Ami]could have it all, my emp[F]ire o[G]f dirt,
[Ami] I will let you dow[F]n, I wi[G]ll make you hurt.
I[Ami]f I could start again,[F] a million [G]miles away,
[Ami] I would keep myself, I w[F]ould[G, Ami] find a way.
